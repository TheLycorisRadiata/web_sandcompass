# Personal website

Sand Compass stems from an old website of mine, back in 2015. I've reworked it few months ago, which you can find in the "old\_personal\_website" repo, but I've put it aside to focus on the bootcamp I'm undergoing.  

This third version is made in the context of the bootcamp, where we are asked to do a fullstack project with React, Express and MongoDB. Since Sand Compass fits the requirements, I thought of making something useful to me instead of a mock website.
