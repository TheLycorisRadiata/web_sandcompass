# Website of my future company

*NOTE: The name "Sand Compass" is temporary.*

**Sand Compass** stems from an old website of mine, back in 2015. I've reworked it somewhere in 2021, to then put it aside to focus on the bootcamp I was undergoing at the time.

The current version is the third one and it was started in the context of the bootcamp, where we were asked to do a fullstack project with the MERN stack. Since **Sand Compass** fits the requirements, I thought of making something useful to me instead of a mock website.

Note that the first and second versions aren't available to the public.
