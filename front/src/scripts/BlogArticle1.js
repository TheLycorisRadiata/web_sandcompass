				<h2>[01/16/2017] How to make a lovable character and what heroes are made of</h2>
				<p>It's my first article, congrats me! I've been thinking of a few topics since the creation of the website but I was never in the right mood to write. I've just seen on 
				YouTube the video of K.M. Weiland entitled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tmuv2qjlU4" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">"I Hate Your Protagonist! Want to 
				Know Why?"</a> and a comment struck me. So I decided to answer it and this article is a version a little bit more polished. I am Kazan on YouTube if you wonder. I find the 
				topic very interesting and that's why I write an article. In short the author was saying that goodness in a protagonist can make them distateful, instead of making us feel 
				close to them and appreciate them even a little. Because when some people want to make a hero protagonist, they make them deeply good, who don't say a word higher than the 
				other and who always keep calm, etc. On top of it being boring, we do not care about the fate of such a character. If we don't have to make an anti-hero, we can find it 
				interesting to make a real "person" and not an always perfect kind of saint. She said also that a character deceives us when we learn to know them and they change all of a 
				sudden, making us realize that everything we believed about them was only an illusion, or rather a lie on behalf of the author.</p>

				<p>The comment I answered to therefore asked to K.M., worried: "What if my protagonist's goal is to find out who he is? He will transform, but I warned everyone ^^' He starts 
				out as nice guy, then he becomes a jerk, and does something very good to the world at the end. I read a few stories like this and I loved them, but I really wonder of your 
				opinion."</p>

				<p>I believe that the person can absolutely do this as long as we understand why the character changes in such a way, from nice guy to jerk, and then to the point of doing 
				something good for the world, because we only need to understand to appreciate a character, not to agree with. Understanding brings coherence, and this is the most important 
				of all the aspects of a story, always. Not that the character is always coherent with themselves, but that their incoherence should happen with the setting in which the 
				character evolves and the personality they start with. That way, this is not an incoherence, on the contrary. K.M. Weiland said that the problem was that we're expecting 
				something from the character, for them to just betray us by changing all of a sudden, without any reason. There may be reasons, but they have to be explained, even in a 
				succinct way. We must be able to see the transition from a state to another, we need to see the character evolve before our eyes, and not behind our back to the point that 
				we realize that the perception we had of them was maybe completely wrong from the beginning. We should be able to trust the author about the fact that if we don't 
				understand an attitude right away, we will in the future. It's not about receiving these pieces of information later on, but that these make sense. Coherence, always, and 
				not a farfetched plot because the author wanted a scene or traits in particular. The character has been done in a certain way, we then need to let them evolve by 
				themselves, or to kill and replace, not to twist them to our goodwill. Without speaking of our own feelings on the matter, it makes at least a bad story and people will 
				hate your character. Incoherence obliterates the pact signed between the author and the reader, the "willing suspension of disbelief", or as I will call it "SOD". The SOD 
				is the fact of believing in the reality of a fictitious story, for the time of this story. Getting into the story, in other words, and for this we have to never see the 
				signs that tell us "This is a story, somebody wrote it". When a character changes in an illogical way, just <em>because</em>, we see that they're a mere tool in the hands 
				of their creator and that we can't feel concerned by what happens to them. They become a marionette who can only deceive us, since the author proved that we couldn't count 
				on what the character shows us, because it may disappear on the next page. What is true and what isn't? One must not fall however into the longish explanation or the 
				heavy-ass justification, but this is a balance you'll gain with training, I'm not even sure myself to have reached a good result, afraid that readers won't get the 
				evolution of a character. Even so we need to keep this idea inside our head, and I believe that writing too much is better than not enough, held by the opposite fear to be 
				uninteresting. Showing the first pages of <em>Cosmic Dust</em>'s first version, the only ones I got at the time, has enabled me to understand that I should be less scared 
				to spread, and that wanting to be sober is on the contrary what would nip my novel in the bud. Or rather, that I confused sobriety and scarcity.</p>

				<p>I then come back to the character of this person. While being a jerk, he has to believe that he is within his rights, that what he does is good. Not because society 
				thinks that it is, people might on the contrary hate and reject him for his behavior. He has to believe that what he does is good because he feels that this is what he must 
				do in order to be happy someday, or that he begins to get how the world works (or rather believes it) and that this is the correct way to live, instead of doing everything 
				for the love of others. And in the said story he commits a very good action for this same world, I interpret it as having realized that he can be wrong on some points, and 
				acting in consequence. For if he doesn't go through this change, this situational turnaround doesn't work, unless he does this kind gesture for himself, and in that case he 
				is still a jerk and it can be just fine like this.</p>

				<p>What makes a protagonist a hero is not their personality traits, not what they say, but their actions and what they think of them. We need these two things, because as I 
				said they can very well save the world and still be an asshole, if they do so to get something afterwards, and not because they care about people's fate. It is nonetheless 
				possible to change this character into a hero, or to get close to it. They've done this action for themselves, but they understand then what good their action did to others 
				and that it matters, and this makes them grateful to have been selfish enough at that time to take this decision, because otherwise all these people would have been lost. 
				This way, if the story goes on, the character is at this time on the verge of becoming the person they really are: this hero.</p>
