				<h2>[02/11/2018] The character and the player</h2>
				<p>In my video game project, there are several ethnicities. If some have the same face, others distinguish themselves by their physique. I thought that would be a problem for 
				players, but I then remember of my own experience. In World of Warcraft, we chose a race depending on their physique, at the risk of missing out on an interesting lore. This 
				will therefore not be a designing mistake on my side, but simply a part of the game, and I don't have to worry that some people miss out on a culture that suits them most, 
				just because they don't like an appearance or prefer another.</p>

				<p>I can stop the article here, but it needs to be filled, doesn't it? So I think about the detractors of video games. Some people would see racism in this choice the players 
				made. Yet, I'll go as far as saying that this choice is as legitimate in reality. One has the right to have the tastes they want, whether it be for our own appearance or the 
				one of our lovers. It doesn't mean we can't befriend all the origins in the world. And if, to go back to the game, ethnicities are insulted in it, this is not a criticism of 
				the real ethnicity from which their physique is inspired, but simple rivalities in this roleplaying game. For yes, we have the right to hate a fictitious ethnicity, if this 
				is what our character feels.</p>

				<p>I wish people can chill and play dubious characters if they wish so, because the interest of fiction is there: doing what we want without any consequences from the real 
				world. Do you know of catharsis, detractors, or simply of fun? So yes, I will be told that slaughtering people should not be an entertainment, but discuss a bit with these 
				players and you'll see that they're no rapist or genocidal persons. Most of them. It's the same as reproaching an actor for playing this kind of character. Being a roleplayer 
				asks admittedly to invest more of oneself, it's matter of discussion, but an actor also pretends to be his character for the time of the filming. He embraces all of their 
				feelings and their way of thinking, as terrible as these are, but he does not become said individual. He puts himself in their shoes, and he acts, that's it. Unless he has a 
				psychological issue the character leaves his mind, and the actor remains himself. If such a person would blow a fuse and do a serious fuck-up, it would not be said "Ah it's 
				the cinema's fault." We'd understand he had a problem, and that all his violent roles revealed it. So why demonizing video games? This is you, the detractors, who confuse 
				fiction and reality, and not these people who want to play chilled out. Myself I find benefits in hunting, but would rather not kill any animal (or person #SerialKiller), 
				so a game is a fit for me. I can forget my qualms and play a character different from what I am, even if we can be very similar. I can be called a coward or a faggot for 
				refusing to take lives for pleasure, at least I can enjoy this entertainment without harming anyone. Video games have certainly saved more lives than you think.</p>
