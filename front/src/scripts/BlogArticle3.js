				<h2>[02/15/2018] The VR film</h2>
				<p>If we use virtual reality (VR) for something else than video game, we might as well do our best to revolutionize the film. This was my thinking as I watched 
				the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2-JvarJiqI" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">video</a> of the Fossoyeur last March (no eng subtitles yet). The 
				article has lied around for a long time among my notes, and being tired that day I haven't noted all my conclusions, but today I finally clean up what I have. Yes, I 
				took the time to note this detail, though.</p>

				<p>When VR film is evoked several questions come up. Is it a film or a video game, and does it even have a future? To answer it, let's first have a look at the difference 
				between film and video game. Although both media illustrate fiction with image and sound, they distinguish from one another on the place they give to the "user." In the 
				story, he plays in a movie the viewer role and in a video game the actor role. The viewer observes without intervening, when the actor benefits from an interaction to a 
				certain degree, which will depend on the experience the game developer wants to offer. This interaction goes from the moving of setting's elements to help the characters, 
				without being noticed by them, to the fact of being himself a character of the story. Thus my vision of what must be called "VR film" is well and truly a film and not a 
				video game or an experience. VR film already exist, I'm said... That is true, and it corresponds to a 3D film in 360°. Does it have, in my opinion, a future? I don't think 
				so. Should I stop here? No. I don't see the point of VR film in its current version, and I will prove in this article that we can offer a better experience without tumbling 
				into a video game. I am convinced we can do a narrative medium where we move about the setting, and that distinguishes itself enough from games and other experiences in 
				virtual reality to be qualified as film.</p>

				<p>The impossibility of moving the camera in 360° film is a problem because we miss things. When we watch a movie, we want to have all the elements before our eyes to ponder 
				over them, and we can watch the film again to better understand what we have <strong>already</strong> seen. If we insist on having a finer understanding of the story, two 
				wiewings can therefore suffice depending on our abilities, but this is not the case with a 360° film. Indeed, we would have even more viewings to do because, not knowing 
				where to look, we may have missed important elements. There are other issues with this type of film. Depending on the frame, we have to move our head to look at character A, 
				then character B, and it's fucking tiresome. Ok, let's change that then... If all the action is in front of us, and so we don't need to spin the camera, what is the interest 
				of the 360°? An interest identical to 3D cinema, nice, but not transcending. Superficial? We're therefore in a dead end: the 360° would make the several viewings mandatory, 
				but we get around this issue by not putting anything of interest in the viewer's back... Why insisting? We may as well do a movie in a classic way. What would be 
				interesting, though, is to use the 360° film to represent the point of view of a disabled, I agree, but a medium must be able to illustrate all types of story. We don't 
				chose to do a novel, a comics, a video game, a movie or a series in accordance with the story we want to tell, but with how we want it to be received by the public. If the 
				story remains the same for the characters, what changes from a medium to another is the experience we want to offer... And in the case of the 360° film, the only experience 
				available is the frustration of not being able to walk, which thus limits the number of stories that can be represented.</p>

				<p>If we want to use a medium such as VR and not a simple screen, we can go as far as letting the viewer choose the frame. Allowing the camera to spin on its 
				axis <strong>is not</strong> allowing one's own frame. The filmmaker is the one who made this choice, and he extended the frame so it goes all around us. It's the cinema way 
				traced upon virtual reality, and it just doesn't work. Each technology should spur us to freshen our craft. Venturing into a new medium with old techniques when it is still 
				in its infancy, yes, but after several years it would be time to question our art and to push back the entertainment frontiers. Let's move on. I'm not saying we can't do 
				some interesting works this way, but it still looks so amateur or experimental to have a real future. If we must not forget that cinema used to be mocked in its beginning, 
				not better considered than funfair's attractions, far from being considered as art... For "the 360° film," or even "the current VR film," I believe this is justified. To 
				hope that VR film stands by the cinema film's side, we need to trust the viewer and entrust the camera into his hands.</p>

				<p>Let's take the example of a VR detective movie. We see the crime scene at the same time as the characters and, as with every film, we try to understand things before 
				they do. We can follow them close, step back as far as possible to see the whole room, or listen to them with a distracted ear and observe a detail they're not paying 
				attention to. This is our place to choose if we want to follow their story, or go beyond what a 2D film can offer by "writing" our own version, to maybe find ourselves 
				surprised when they pull out a clue we hadn't seen or had judged pointless. While they go through their adventure, we feel like their mate or colleague, because we go 
				together, even if we cannot interact with them... Like in a movie of the classic kind. We can feel close to the characters even though we don't exist to them and remain 
				behind a screen. To me a film is that, just observing.</p>
